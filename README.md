# My-DSA-Journey

This repository contains a collection of Java programs and resources for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal of this project is to improve problem-solving skills and understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures through hands-on coding exercises.

## Contents

- Java source files (.java) with various algorithmic problems and solutions.
- Compiled Java class files (.class) for some of the source files.
- A PDF file `150-DSA-questions.pdf` containing a curated list of 150 DSA questions for practice.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the Java programs, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Compile a Java file

```bash
javac filename.java
```

### Run a compiled Java class

```bash
java ClassName
```

Replace `filename.java` and `ClassName` with the actual file and class names.

## Example Files

- `first.java` - Example Java program.
- `subarray.java` - Program related to subarray problems.
- `practiceQ.java` - Practice questions implemented in Java.
- `pat8.java` - Pattern printing program.
